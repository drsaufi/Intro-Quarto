## Please Read

This report has been created as a learning exercise on how to generate *interactive* and *engaging* reports using **Quarto**.

It demonstrates the integration of various **R packages** for data *exploration*, *visualization*, and *data analysis*, with a focus on creating a **dynamic** and **user-friendly** report layout.

The use of interactive elements, such as *tabs*, *tables*, and *visualizations*, is emphasized to showcase the versatility of **Quarto** in producing polished and professional reports.

## Disclaimer

This report is intended solely for educational purposes. The analyses and interpretations provided here are based on the **Palmer Penguins** dataset and serve as examples to practice data analysis and visualization techniques.

# Introduction

The objective of this report is to demonstrate a **data analysis workflow** using the `palmerpenguins` package, which offers an excellent dataset for data *exploration* and *visualization*.

## Palmer Penguins

The package contains data on *344 penguins* across three species, collected from three different islands in the **Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica**[^1]. The data was gathered by **Dr. Kristen Gorman** and the **Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER**[^2].

[^1]: The Palmer Archipelago is a group of islands located off the northwestern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.

[^2]: The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network is a collaborative program that conducts long-term studies to monitor and understand ecological processes. The Palmer Station in Antarctica is part of this network, conducting critical research on the region's unique ecosystem.

## Setting Up the Environment

This analysis requires several packages. The following packages will be used throughout the report for data *manipulation*, *visualization*, and *data analysis*.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins) # <1>
library(tidyverse) # <2>
library(DT) # <3>
library(ggplot2) # <4>
```

1.  To use dataset for analysis.
2.  For data manipulation and visualization.
3.  To create interactive data tables.
4.  For creating customizable visualizations.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's dive deeper into the `penguins` dataset to explore its *features* and *structure*.

## Summary of Dataset

```{r}
data("penguins")
summary(penguins)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The **Palmer Penguins** dataset contains *344 penguins* from three distinct species: **Adelie** (152), **Chinstrap** (68), and **Gentoo** (124). These penguins were observed on three islands within the Palmer Archipelago: **Biscoe**, **Dream**, and **Torgersen**.

2.  The dataset includes several key measurements:

    -   The **bill length**, which ranges from 32.1 mm to 59.6 mm with an average of 43.92 mm, and

    -   The **bill depth**, ranging from 13.1 mm to 21.5 mm, with an average of 17.15 mm.

    -   The **flipper length** varies between 172 mm and 231 mm, averaging 200.9 mm.

    -   The **body mass** ranges from 2700 g to 6300 g, with a mean of 4202 g.

3.  The dataset provides information on the sex of the penguins, with *165 females* and *168 males*, though 11 entries for sex are missing.

4.  The data was collected over three years: **2007**, **2008**, and **2009**, with a few missing values for bill length and bill depth (2 entries each).

## Descriptive Tables

The `DT` package allows us to create an **interactive table** that enables *filtering*, *searching*, and *sorting* based on specific columns, offering a dynamic way to explore the dataset further.

```{r}
datatable(penguins, filter = "top")
```

# Data Visualization

Let us explore various **visualizations** that can be generated from the **Palmer Penguins** dataset using the `ggplot2` package. These visualizations, inspired by Allison Horst, provide insights into the relationships between key variables.

## Penguin Mass vs. Flipper Length

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")

mass_flipper
```

::: column-margin
This graph illustrates the relationship between flipper length and body mass for three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, based on data collected at Palmer Station LTER. This visualization highlights the species-specific differences in body mass and flipper length.

flipper_bill
```

::: column-margin
This graph visualizes the relationship between flipper length (mm) and bill length (mm) for three penguin species. It highlights species-specific variations in bill and flipper length, showing that Gentoo penguins tend to have the longest flippers, while Chinstrap penguins exhibit the greatest variability in bill length.

## Using Tabs for Multiple Graphs

Including **multiple graphs** in a report can sometimes make it feel *cluttered*. By organizing the graphs into **tabs**, we give readers the *flexibility* to easily navigate and view only the visualizations they are interested in. This approach keeps the report *clean* and more *user-friendly,* allowing for a better browsing experience.
